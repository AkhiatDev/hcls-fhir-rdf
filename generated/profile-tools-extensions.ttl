        comment
        ValueSet.compose.include.code
        string
        0..1
        This is used in various FHIR value sets to make comments on how particular codes are used when the formal definition is a little abstract or vague, but it's not clear whether it belongs in the actual value set resource
      
      
        display
        ValueSet.compose.include.code
        string
        0..1
        An alternative display is used to tailor a code's description to a particular use case. Doing this is dangerous, because it's easy to introduce a different meaning for the code in this context, but it's also useful to make the display suitable for a particular kind of user in a particular kind of context
      
      
        definition
        ValueSet.compose.include.code
        string
        0..1
        This is provided for when the source code system doesn't actually provide a definition (there are many such). Providing an definition for a code should not be done where the underlying code system provides a definition
      
      
        issue-source
        OperationOutcome
        string
        0..1
        Helps a user track down the source of the problem
